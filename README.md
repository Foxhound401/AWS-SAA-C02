# AWS-SAA-C02 study notes

Goal: I want to get the cert in one month

- I have experience with AWS, and have access to resources to test and do hand-on
- I have strong experience with linux
- I have strong experience with docker
- I have strong experience with k8s
- ~~I know vim, vim will speed up the process 300%~~

Weakness:
- I'm not very good at networking, knowing the basic, still not get the NAT and the DHCP, CIDR block...
..- I understand port
..- I understand tcp, inbound, outbound connection. 

- Slow learner, have to reread a lot and take a lot of notes to understand
=> then why the heck you want it in one month.  \(T^T)/
